# Colemator zmk-config

This is my personal [ZMK firmware](https://github.com/zmkfirmware/zmk/) configuration, 
which I named Colemator because it is built around two popular layouts: 
[**Colema**k-DH](https://colemakmods.github.io/mod-dh/) (for English) and 
[Dik**tor**](https://github.com/mshkrebtan/diktor) (for Russian, modified by myself 
to accomodate for a 6x3 ergonomic split keyboard). It is heavily inspired by Miryoku layout 
(primarily by its general principles) and extends it with a number of advanced features.

## Supported keyboards

The support for keyboards added through modules. Currently the firmware is built for 
the following keyboards:

- [Ergonaut One](https://github.com/ergonautkb/one)
- [Dao Choc BLE](https://github.com/yumagulovrn/dao-choc-ble)
- [Zireael](https://github.com/Mposiblee/Zireael)
- [Corne](https://github.com/foostan/crkbd)
